Mission statement:

Futel is a social service and arts organization dedicated to providing communication tools for all communities. We install public telephones, provide telecommunications services for houseless support organizations, and develop extremely accessible interactive art installations.

Org bio:

We installed our first public telephone in August 2014, and have continued to expand our services with the support of many volunteers and contributors. Recent funding has come from the Regional Arts and Culture Council and the Precipice Fund.

Technical details:

Futel uses salvage payphones, thrift store landlines, obsolete IT hardware kept alive with open source firmware, rented cloud computers, and bulk telephony services paid for by the minute.
