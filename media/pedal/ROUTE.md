VERY VERY EARLY SUPER PRELIMINARY MAP ROUTE RESERVING
ALL RIGHTS TO CHANGE THIS AND NOT PUBLISH THIS EVER AT
ALL ON PEDALPALOOZA SITES: 
[https://goo.gl/maps/ifGUMuJvQkzB2v247](https://goo.gl/maps/ifGUMuJvQkzB2v247)

The idea here is to plan the route and what content we might
like to say/try at each stop.  This is not generally stuff
that would be on any pedalpalooza ride, but is def not a 
big secret.  More like notecards.

Could probably use help getting the phone names to canon if we like that?

Should/could work in AFRU or Diode or ^H for a diversion?

Potential Carlos signs still out there? Be on the lookout! Fun stops.
