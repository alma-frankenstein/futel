[Futel](https://futel.net) FUNdRAGER!

* When: <tbd>
* Where: <tbd> (maybe Woodlawn or Alberta Park)

Phone phreaks, artists, miscreants, and hackers will join forces 
to learn about [FUTEL](https://futel.net) -- Portland's fastest-growing
free payphone provider.

On this relaxed 15 mile ride, we will visit 10 [FUTEL](https://futel.net) 
telephone locations and learn about each phone's unique location and history.
Riders will have ample opportunity to experiment with the phones while learning
about Futel's past, present, and future.

Futel is a 501c3 nonprofit community.
Ride is free, with donations welcome/encouraged.

Not a loop, estimated 2hrs. We will end at Upright Brewing for refreshments.
