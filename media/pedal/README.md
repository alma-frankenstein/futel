Say HELLO!

Let's do a ride to visit 10 various [FUTEL](https://futel.net) telephone 
locations and learn more about the nation's HOTTEST and 
fastest growing payphone provider.

This is a 15-20 mile ride with MANY stops and very little climbing.
At each stop we will learn a little more about each phone and the
history of Futel.
