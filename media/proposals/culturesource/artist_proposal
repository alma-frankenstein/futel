Futel is looking for artists, activists, oral historians, and any other audio content creators to collaborate with our first public installations in Detroit.


About Futel:

Futel is a social service and arts organization with the mission of providing highly accessible communication tools. We install telephones in public locations which provide free telephone calls, services, and participatory experiences at all hours. We also provide free telephone and telecommunications services to houseless support and advocacy organizations, and develop interactive audio art pieces which are accessible from our public phones, incoming lines, and occasional gallery installations.

We use salvaged payphones, thrift store landlines, obsolete IT hardware kept alive with open source firmware, rented cloud computers, and bulk telephony services paid for by the minute.

About the project:

We are seeking contributions to allow our phones to support their neighborhoods culturally in addition to the services and amusements that they provide. At the simplest level, these could be an audio pieces to be showcased on our phone voice menus, such as music or spoken word. A more advanced piece could involve interactivity using the phone's keypad, microphone, and software. Current and previous works on our phones include local oral history with questions for users, a gentrification discussion, advice from live operators, hacker manifestos, puzzles, and an audio zine based on contributions from phone users.

Contributors that can be named in a successful grant proposal will get a stipend.

Futel will provide operational, development, and creative support to allow contributors to effectively use the medium of our installations.
