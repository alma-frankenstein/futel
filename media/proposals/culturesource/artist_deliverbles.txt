Futel is looking for content to support our Creators of Culture grant.

We are looking for content to be integrated with the Futel platform. For example, MP3s ready to be put into our menu-driven interface.

We currently have $500 earmarked for artist fees. This covers content, production, everything.

One example of a complete contribution would be several audio files: an introduction of 1 minute and 3-5 pieces (interviews, monologues, music, poetry, etc) of 1-5 minutes each. We would integrate this with the Futel phone menus.

Another example of a complete contribution would be a short speech that asks several questions, then, after 6 months or so, a curation and integration of several responses after they have been collected from the phone. We would integrate the first iteration with the Futel menus, collect the responses, and integrate the second interation.

Strong contributions will allow our phones to support their neighborhoods culturally in addition to the services and amusements that they provide. Current and previous works on our phones include local oral history with questions for users, a gentrification discussion, advice from live operators, hacker manifestos, puzzles, and an audio zine based on contributions from phone users.
