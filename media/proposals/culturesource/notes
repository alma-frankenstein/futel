proposal questions that can emphasize the local partners: 

3) Do you have community partners? If so, please describe who are they and how are they involved in shaping your project? (up to 150 words)

4)Does your project promote a more inclusive, equitable community? If so, please describe. (up to 150 words)

5) Who are some of the creative people involved? Who are some of the project managers (if they are different people)? How do the creators plan and work together? (up to 150 words)


Also, any ideas for promotion would help the proposal. What media might cover this? What other methods, flyering, zine distribution? How to document this, budget worker hours and printing?
