for me:
- is futel in there?
-- phones left
-- phones in pyramid
-- expand futel

anything else to update?
broader points mainly

impact statement?
can we use that to talk about anything left to address?

anything else you want to share part
philosophy
connection between calls and podcasts



David's draft:

1) Services - 3 trainings in Feb and March for villagers on audio equipment use, interviewing skills, and editing. Residents of all 4 villages are invited. Participants spend April and May interviewing and editing to produce an oral history of the village building movement in Portland (or some aspect thereof, like the establishment of Hazelnut Grove, etc). 

2) Culminating in Event - Village Building Convergence (in June) evening event to premier Chapter 1 of the oral history project. The work is distributed via our websites, social media, and Futel phones, with the intention of establishing an ongoing training and media development program.

My notes:

- 3 training events Feb, Mar
-- how to use equipment
-- participants choose formats and themes to work on

- Participants generate, gather content Apr

- 1 or more editing events May
-- participants and editors do rough edits, generate filler, etc

- Final edits May
-- editors finish final content

- Event June

- Distribution July and on
-- phones, website, etc

point of media? help survival of villages by showing neighbors that tehy are aligned?

more about village building convergence, what is it?

Feb/Mar may be too early, when does grant gets approved? Push back a month?

"inside a prison" podcast
