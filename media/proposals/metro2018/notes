David's draft:

1) Services - 3 trainings in Feb and March for villagers on audio equipment use, interviewing skills, and editing. Residents of all 4 villages are invited. Participants spend April and May interviewing and editing to produce an oral history of the village building movement in Portland (or some aspect thereof, like the establishment of Hazelnut Grove, etc). 

2) Culminating in Event - Village Building Convergence (in June) evening event to premier Chapter 1 of the oral history project. The work is distributed via our websites, social media, and Futel phones, with the intention of establishing an ongoing training and media development program.
