I'm applying Futel to a Metro Placemaking grant. We're partnering with the Village Coalition. The plan is to install phones at more VC sites - R2D2, Kenton, Dignity - and also include creative audio projects for VC residents to participate in. The projects are currently open-ended, but are basically podcasts and/or call-in shows, or whatever else the VC participants want to do. The grant is still in development, but the gist is:

- VC residents attend workshops with Futel facilitators to learn technical and artistic techniques
- VC residents are loaned recording equipment
- VC residents create content using equipment and using Futel phones
- other contributors create content using Futel phones and Futel incoming lines
- VC residents attend workshops with Futel facilitators to curate, update, edit content
- Futel facilitators edit content to produce audio shows
- audio shows are distributed via the web, Futel phones, and however else VC wants to use it

Open Signal could provide:

- technical support and training
- workshop space
- portable recording equipment
- equipment and studios for editing
