Futel: Telephone Calls From The Future

Description

Futel is a network of six public telephones, providing free calls, interactive audio art, human interaction, and links to services. The goal of the project is best described as a Situationist-inspired combination of urban public art and social services.

We propose to install a Futel payphone in the unoccupied payphone enclosure at the Sou'Wester Lodge. This installation will showcase a new interactive audio project, Telephone Calls From The Future, as well as access to the existing Futel network features, including the Payphone Shotgun, the Wildcard Line, direct links to all existing public Futel telephones, and of course free telephone calls.

Telephone Calls From The Future will incorporate the manipulation of current and previous user input by both machines and human curators. Like other Futel projects, Telephone Calls From The Future will use office technology and the human desire to communicate and find meaning to leverage the creative ability of its operators and artists.
