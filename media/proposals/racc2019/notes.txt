Project Summary
Futel will install one new public installation. This will use salvaged payphones and payphone enclosures and be accessible to anyone, at all hours.

The installation will feature new interactive audio programs which will allow users of these installations, as well as contributors from other public Futel phone locations, to communicate about issues important to local presence and culture, both economic and cultural.

In addition to using the kiosk to site the project, Futel and contributors will provide development, operational support, and guidance to help contributors effectively use the medium of our installations, with development, production and creative consulting services.

Content developed for this project will also be distributed through other media, including Futel's website, publications, and existing public installations.
