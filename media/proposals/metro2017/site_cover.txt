Hello

I am writing to inquire about donating telephone services to

My organization, Futel, provides free telephones and telephone-mediated services. We provide phone service for Right 2 Dream Too, and we have free phones in several public locations. See the attached flyer for an overview.

Our installations are made up of one or more phones in several form factors, from desk phones to payphones on pedestals. Installations can be customized to include a combination of basic phone services, voicemail, live operator assistance, and interactive and creative features. We are enthusiastic about developing features which will give a voice to local users and be shared with other phone and internet visitors.

Futel supplies all hardware and installation. We are a 501(c)(3) organization supported by grants.

If this is interesting to you, I'd like to tell you more and work out a proposal. I hope to hear from you soon.
