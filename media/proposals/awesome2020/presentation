Hello, I'm Karl Anderson, director of Futel, and we're building public hand washing stations.

Futel is a free public phone network, with over five years of small grant supported operations, including an Awesome Portland grant in September 2014.

We are installing public hand washing stations at sites in Portland, both near our phones and at other sites. This will provide an essential service for many people. We started this program in early April and will continue operating it as long as it remains relevant.

Funds will go towards deploying up to five new new hand washing stations, replacing existing stations and parts as they wear or are damaged, and buying supplies and hardware for the stations and our sanitation program.

We have installed five hand washing stations already, and distributed sanitation kits to a crew of volunteers. However, we started this project without funding and without a budget for expansion, repair, or replacement.

Why are we doing this particular project? The coronavirus pandemic leads us to find ways to address public mental and physical health needs. We notice that the use of our phones remains surprisingly high during this time of fear and distancing, and realize that many of our phone users don't have other options. We want to keep our public telephone users - and anyone else - safe. Hand washing stations will meet a clear need, and like our phones, we hope they will inspire participation in other grassroots and DIY projects.
