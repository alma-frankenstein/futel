Hello, I am Karl Anderson.

I am an artist who tells stories with salvaged technological detritus.

I am applying to the Super Patron Endowment Fund Fuck Yeah to allow me create and deploy new public interactive audio installations.

My medium over the last five years has been, yes, the payphone.

I am founder, director, and chief handset cleaner of the Futel project, which has deployed ten payphones in Portland Oregon, Detroit and Ypsilanti Michigan, and Seaview Washingon.

These payphones are how I present audio installations to urban audiences. They allow me to sneak interactive and collaborative experiences into public environments.

And they provide free phone calls, services, and live interactions with human operators.

The outcome is a combination of armored urban furniture, situationist camouflage, and social outreach that has been highly successful in bringing artistic experiences to diverse participants.

The resources of the Super Patron Endowment Fund Fuck Yeah will allow me to implement new creative content and expansions for the Futel network.

Thank you!
