If you receive the $50k grant, what will you create in the next year? Get us excited, paint us a picture, be specific!

I will expand Futel, my radically accessible public audio art installation which I keep in a network of nine payphones available to the public 24/7.

I will implement four new interactive audio works that use the Futel payphone nework.

I will install four new payphones in Portland, OR, Detroit, MI, and Astoria, OR.

I will keep the Futel network and existing interactive programs running for a year, and talk to a lot of people who need someone to talk to on the Futel network for a year. I will sharply reduce the time I spend hustling for grants. I will have a lot of fun and confuse a lot of people.
