If you receive the $50k grant, what will you create in the next year? Get us excited, paint us a picture, be specific!

The resources of the grant will let me expand and grow my creative work with Futel, my radically accessible audio art installation which I deploy in a network of ten payphones usable from public sidewalks.

I will create four new interactive audio works for the Futel installation, to be released quarterly. These will be publicly available throughout 2020 alongside existing Futel audio works and communication features.

I will install four new Futel payphones in Portland and Detroit.
