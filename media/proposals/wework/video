Hello, I'm Karl Anderson, director and chief handset sanitizer of Futel

Futel is dedicated to providing radically accessible communication tools and creative opportunities. Our mission combines social service and artistic expression.

The tool we base this on is the telephone, a simple and powerful device that used to be found on many urban street corners.

We refurbish and install payphones that are free and accessible to the public.
Combined with our hardware and cloud services,
these provide free calls, service directories, and other useful features
We also use them to collaborative with our users to create interactive artistic audio works.
And, we offer live operator assistance 24 hours a day.
We also link up donated internet service for communities that need it, and provide IT consulting and other access to tools.

We have 5 public phones in Portland Oregon and Ypsilanti Michigan. We also have a phone and network at Right To Dream Too in Portland, a site providing temporary housing and support for the houseless. We installed our first phone in 2014.

Our funding comes from grants, and we are staffed by volunteers donating many services, including software engineering, ops, hardware hacking, construction, design, and administration. We have also partnered with local organizations, including the Village Coalition, the City Repair Project, and the Personal Telco Project.

A Creator Awards prize will help us to both continue our current work and expand it into new directions.

lots to do

thanks for your consideration
