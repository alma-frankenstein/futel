Hello, I'm Karl Anderson, founder, director, and chief handset sanitizer of Futel

Futel is an organization dedicated to providing radically accessible communication tools and creative opportunities. Our mission combines social service and artistic expression.

The tool we base that around is the telephone, a simple and powerful device that used to be found on many urban street corners.

We install payphones that are free and accessible to the public at all hours
these provide free calls, service directories, and other useful features
We also use them to collaborative with our users to create interactive artistic audio works.
And, we offer live operator assistance 24 hours a day.

Basically, we refurbish payphones, install them on sidewalks, combine them with salvaged IT equipment and our cloud services, buy telephone service for it all, and then give it away. We also link up donated internet service for communities that need it, and provide pedestrian IT consulting and other access to tools.

We have 5 public phones in Portland Oregon and Ypsilanti Michigan. We also have a phone and network at Right To Dream Too in Portland, a site providing temporary housing and support for houseless individuals. We installed our first phone in 2014.

Our funding comes from grants, and we are staffed by volunteers donating many services, including software engineering, ops, hardware hacking, construction, and administration.

Partnerships with local organizations have been important for our success, including the Village Coalition, the City Repair Project, and the Personal Telco Project.

A Creator Awards prize will help us to both continue our current work and expand it into new directions.

lots to do

thanks for your consideration
