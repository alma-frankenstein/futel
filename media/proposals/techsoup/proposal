To whom it may concern,

Futel, an Umbrella project, has the primary mission of providing communications services to public individuals, with an emphasis on technologically disadvantaged populations.

Activities which illustrate our organization's purpose include the provisioning and maintenance of five public telephones featuring free telephone calls, service directories, interactive audio, and other communication features in Portland, Oregon and Ypsilanti, Michigan, and the provisioning and maintenance of a telephone installation at Right To Dream Too, a rest area for houseless individuals in Portland, Oregon.

Futel has been providing public communications services continuously since 2014.
