next metro placemaking grant January, open 4 wks
docs mid Dec
grant criteria will be updated - 2017 placemaking program was 1st

good response from judges, innovative
unhoused community++
phones provide connectivity, that is good

getting more comminity together would be a help
interaction with surrounding neighborhoods?
describe something around the infrastructure
for example, programs that use the infra
example, events
example, bring an artist to use it
this is what the workshops were in 2017 proposal! But it wasn't fleshed out enough
2018 program will be a shorter application will hopefully make this more clear

can we do some kind of event? community?
partner with a group that handles that? She suggested possibly maxing out grant amount to allow that?
we do the infrastructure, they do the human part
'event' is meant loosely
"something involving the humanness of the residents"
"infratructure alone is difficult to rise to the top"
need storytelling or something
infractructure is a means to provide that

talk again when new grant comes out

"this is an equity based program"
racial equity strategy, strong focus on communities of color
can that be strengthened?

post conversation thoughts
village coalition rep was very interested in my ideas from 2017 proposal, the idea was strong, develop it
village coalitoin rep suggested developing ideas for outreach uses, community artistic programs, do that
