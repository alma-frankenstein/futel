Futel is an organization dedicated to the revitalization of the telephone as a public good. Our growing network combines salvaged phone booths with internet voice transmission, allowing for the custom programming of push-button menus and the integration of art projects such as poetry and interactive games. We have maintained a telephone at Right2Dream Too since 2015, and we have 5 free public payphones in Portland and one in Ypsilanti, Michigan.

-- name of partner artist and theme of contribution
- Futel will install, maintain, and provision two new public installations.
- Futel will provide development and operational support for partner artist
-- Futel will implement platform to realize artistic project
-- Futel will provide advice and guidance to help artist effectively use medium
- Open Signal will provide production and other services and consulting?

In addition, Futel will continue to maintain and provision our existing six public installations and public phone numbers, which can also be used to access these features.

All installations will also provide existing Futel features, including free telephone and communication services and interactive audio art.

Yes.

10. Is there anything else you want to share? (*max 1,500)

Not so long ago, the phone booth was a common feature of our social landscape. But as privately-owned smartphones have become ubiquitous, public payphones have disappeared, along with their functionality and the sense of a shared utility. For the most vulnerable in our community, a telephone can be a lifeline, providing access to services, job opportunities and contact with family and friends.

Futel believes in democratizing communication, applying a hacker spirit and a mix of old and new technology. Inspired by models of DIY publishing and distribution such as zines, file sharing, and ham radio, we want our network to be useful for both making calls and making art. Podcasting, oral history and storytelling are a natural direction for our projects. Our network already provides audio art with public interactions, including our podcast Wildcard Line, which features contributions from users of public Futel phones.
