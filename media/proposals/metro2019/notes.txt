4. What will you do? Describe your project. (*max. 2,500)

Futel will install two new public kiosks, and update our six existing kiosks, to provide an instance of the Black Spatial Imaginaries project with Sharita Towne. The kiosks will remain in operation for at least one year.

Futel's growing network combines salvaged phone booths with internet voice transmission, allowing for the custom programming of push-button menus and the integration of art projects such as poetry and interactive games. We have maintained a telephone at Right2Dream Too since 2015, and we have six free public payphones in Portland and one in Ypsilanti, Michigan. The integration of Black Spatial Imaginaries will augment Futel's existing interactive audio content.

In addition to using our kiosks to site the project, Futel will provide development, operational support, and guidance to help Sharita Towne effectively use the medium of our installations.

Open Signal will provide production, consulting, and other services.

All installations will also provide existing Futel features, including free telephone and communication services and interactive audio art.

5. Where will the project happen? Is there anything you want to share about this place/these places? (*max 1,000)

IMPORTANT: Begin with an address, and use this format: 1234 NE Main Street, Your Town, Zip (This is for mapping

6. How will communities of color be involved? Are there leadership roles for people of color? What about other historically marginalized communities? (*max. 1,500)

As the creator of Black Spatial Imaginaries, which will be the primary focus of the two new installations, Sharita Towne will have artistic leadership over the project. In addition, Black Spatial Imaginaries involves and addresses the issues of communities of color.

7. How will the project make people feel more connected to each other and the place(s) where it will happen? (*max 1,500) 

In addition to supporting neighbors of our installations with a basic communications utility, Futel provides a platform for dialogue and storytelling. We hope to help people join in the celebration of community histories

8. How do you think you'll be able to tell if the project had an impact? For instance, what would change? (*max 1,000) 

- metrics documenting use of features
- participation in interactive features

While Futel does not collect any personal information other than that supplied voluntarily by the users, we are able to collect data, allowing us to determine which locations and features are being utilized.

9. Each grant cycle, a number of shared themes emerge from community members' applications. Would you be interested in participating in a small group conversation with planners, decision-makers and other applicants? 

Yes.

10. Is there anything else you want to share? (*max 1,500)

Not so long ago, the phone booth was a common feature of our social landscape. But as privately-owned smartphones have become ubiquitous, public payphones have disappeared, along with their functionality and the sense of a shared utility. For the most vulnerable in our community, a telephone can be a lifeline, providing access to services, job opportunities and contact with family and friends.

Futel believes in democratizing communication, applying a hacker spirit and a mix of old and new technology. Inspired by models of DIY publishing and distribution such as zines, file sharing, and ham radio, we want our network to be useful for both making calls and making art. Podcasting, oral history and storytelling are a natural direction for our projects. Our network already provides audio art with public interactions, including our podcast Wildcard Line, which features contributions from users of public Futel phones.
