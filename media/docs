Condensed mission statement:

Futel is a social service and arts organization dedicated to providing communication tools for all communities. Futel installs public telephones, provides telecommunications services for houseless support organizations, and develops extremely accessible interactive art installations. Futel installed its first public telephone in August 2014, and has continued to expand its services with the support of many volunteers and contributors. Recent funding has come from the Regional Arts and Culture Council and the Precipice Fund. Futel uses salvage payphones, thrift store landlines, obsolete IT hardware kept alive with open source firmware, rented cloud computers, and bulk telephony services paid for by the minute.


Mission statement:

Futel is a social service and arts organization. We install publicly accessible payphones which provide free telephone calls and voicemail at all hours. We also provide free phone service to houseless support and advocacy organizations, and develop interactive audio art pieces which are accessible from our public phones, incoming lines, and occasional gallery installations.

Org bio:

Futel is a 501(c)(3) organization founded by a bicycle courier and a software engineer. We installed our first public payphone in August 2014, and have continued to expand our services with the support of many volunteers and contributos. Recent funding has come from the Regional Arts and Culture Council and the Precipice Fund.

Technical details:

Futel operates on two substrates. We develop our services using open source VOIP and security software, and deploy them on cloud servers. Users interface with these with a motley collection of repuprosed payphones and obsolete used IT hwardware. The human glue that keeps this all together is a network of live operators and troubleshooters.


Part public service and part public art, Futel is keeping the payphone alive by installing them in public locations and offering free calls and interactive audio experiences. We feel that the constraints of the phone interface both spur creativity and pay homage to a generation of creative hackers.
