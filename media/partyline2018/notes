4: bad line spacing in grants paragraph? Last line is lower?

4/5: bad grouping to put 2 lines on page 5. Put image from page at bottom of page 4, shrink to take up half page? Whitepsace gutters or flow text around. Increase space between paragraphs, have whitespace at bottom of page 5, or add another image to account for smaller filler image? Something like that. Also see next.
