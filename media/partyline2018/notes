There are 3 more pages to fill (24) or one to cut (20).

——
cover: chainmail bikini warrior is meant to be front cover image

2: needs illustration since that was moved to cover
* fixed
4: bad line spacing in grants paragraph? Last line is lower?

* yup- fixed

4/5: bad grouping to put 2 lines on page 5. Put image from page at bottom of page 4, shrink to take up half page? Whitepsace gutters or flow text around. Increase space between paragraphs, have whitespace at bottom of page 5, or add another image to account for smaller filler image? Something like that. Also see next.

6: this is a duplicate of the year in review paragraph. Use this instead of the year in review pararagraph? Remove this page. Continue using image of girl as filler, allowing shrinking of current year in review filler image

* I put the payphone image right under the title, split the text onto the second page, adn bumped up the “Airport phones” image and caption to fill the space.

7: should this article be in a smaller font, maybe make it 1 page smaller?
* two column format shaved a page off

11: more space between filler image and text
* check
11: should URL be moved to footer of article? Or should this just have "reprinted from markmaynard.com"?
* reads “reprinted from markmaynard.com”

12: 1st sentence of image description should be below its image, instead of both sentences below 2nd image with "bottom:"
* couldn’t figure this out/ maybe fixed it?
