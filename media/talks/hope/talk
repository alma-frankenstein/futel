Part public service and part public art, Futel is keeping payphones alive by installing them in public locations and providing free telephone service, telephone-mediated art, and live human interaction.

We feel that the constraints of the phone interface spur creativity, pay homage to a generation of creative hackers, and allow us to worm our way into the minds of large groups of people.

Now that we are finally living in the cyberpunk dystopia promised in the 80s, we are poised to seize this moment. What aspects of the project make it effective, and how can we apply them to other creative technological projects?

  * futel is wildly successful
  * futel is at the cusp of failure at any moment
