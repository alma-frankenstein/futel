==

Congratulations! You have chosen or have been chosen to serve your community as a Futel telephone sanitizer! To succeed at your role, you will need to always follow these simple guidelines.

# Read this first

Keep yourself and your family safe! Telephone sanitization should not put you at risk of infection, but if you are immunocompromised or do not feel safe performing these duties, contact your handler.

# Telephone Sanitizer Guidelines

The purpose of telephone sanitation is primarily to improve the health and safety of Futel users, and secondarily to assure Futel users that the phones are safe to use.

Sanitize the telephone and hand washing station (if so equipped) as often as feasible, and at least daily.

You have received:
- A sanitization solution spray bottle
- A sponge
- A set of latex, nitrile, or rubber gloves
- A sticker packet
- These instructions

Keep all of these items in a storage container such as a grocery bag, away from children. Don't touch them when not in use.

# Sanitization Preparation Procedure

Wash your hands. Put on gloves.

# Telephone Sanitization Procedure

With handset in cradle, spray solution directly on all exposed parts of handset.

Remove handset from cradle. Spray solution directly on all parts of handset, taking care to not spray directly into receiver and transmitter holes.

Spray solution on sponge until moist. Wipe handset receiver and transmitter sponge. Wipe any visible grime from handset with sponge.

Spray solution directly on keypad, coin return lever, and coin return hopper cover. Wipe any visible grime from keypad, coin return lever, and coin return cover with sponge.

Write date and your handle on sanitization sticker. Apply sticker to telephone or enclosure in conspicuous location.

# Hand Washing Station Sanitization Procedure

Spray solution directly on spigot and soap dispenser.

Write date and your handle on sanitization sticker. Apply sticker to station in conspicuous location.

# Safety Notes

If eye protection is not worn, extreme care must be taken to protect eyes and mucous membranes from direct contact with disinfectant. Flush eyes and face with water after contact.

Sanitization can be performed safely without gloves if hands are properly washed after procedure.
